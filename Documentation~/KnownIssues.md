## Some node are empty after an upgrade of package or a new install

Sometimes, it happens that a node ceases to work because of an upgrade of the project or a package. This is likely related to the ShaderGraph embedded in Mixture, for more information you can see this issue: https://github.com/alelievr/Mixture/issues/27

The best way to fix that issue is to reimport the **Mixture** folder under **Packages** in the **Project View**.
